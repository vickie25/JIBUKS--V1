## 🚀 **What I Changed**

### 1. **Premium Floating Navigation Bar** 🧭
I completely redesigned the bottom tab bar to look modern and fix the overlap issues.

*   **Fixed Overlap**: Increased height to **70px** (from 60px) and added **extra bottom padding** specifically for Android. This ensures the icons sit *above* the system navigation buttons (back/home/switch).
*   **Floating Design**: Added shadows and removed the top border for a sleek, "floating" look.
*   **Active States**: When you tap a tab, the icon now gets a subtle **light blue background** circle to clearly show it's active.
*   **Icons**: Used outline icons for inactive state and filled icons for active state (e.g., `home-outline` vs `home`).

### 2. **Added Business Dashboard Tab** 💼
*   You asked for "Business Dashboard" to be included.
*   I added a 5th tab: **Business**.
*   It now sits alongside Home, Analytics, Activity, and Community.

### 3. **Responsive Spacing** 📱
*   Updated **ALL** 5 tab screens (`Home`, `Analytics`, `Transactions`, `Community`, `Business`) to have **100px** of bottom spacing.
*   This ensures that the last item in your lists (like the bottom-most transaction) is never hidden behind the new floating tab bar.
